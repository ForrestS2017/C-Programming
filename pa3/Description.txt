Cache Simulator

This program simulates memory access traces of computer caches. The input is a memory access trace containing memory addresses and actions taken on the addresses.
This program simulates the running of these actions and determines if there is a hit, miss, and resulting actions to perform.
This program supports cache policies: FIFO and LRU, and can handle any cache associativity and size.

Format for trace file:

"Program Counter": "Read (R) / Write (W)" "48-bit memory address"

0x804be19: R 0x9cbad40 
0x804be19: W 0x9cbad40 
0x804be1c: R 0x9cbad44 
0x804be1c: W 0x9cbad44 
0x804be10: R 0xbf8ff498 
#eof 

Usage interface:

./first <cache size> <associativity> <cache policy> <block size> <trace file>

<cache size>: size of cache in bytes, as a power of 2
<associativity>: "direct" for a direct mapped cache, "assoc" for a fully associative cache, or "assoc:n" for an n-way associative cache
<cache policy>: "fifo" for First-In-First-Out, or "lru" for Least Recently Used
<block size>: block size in bytes, as a power of 2
<tracefile>: name of trace file

Output Format:

The output prints out the reads, writes, hits and misses for a no-prefetch run and a pre-fetch run.

no-prefetch 
Memory reads: 3498 
Memory writes: 2862 
Cache hits: 6502 
Cache misses: 3498 
with-prefetch 
Memory reads: 3522 
Memory writes: 2862 
Cache hits: 8125 
Cache misses: 1875
